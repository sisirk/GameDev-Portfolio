    <h1>Hello!</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <div>
        I'm <strong>Sisir Kadiveti</strong>, a software engineer turned indie game developer.<br/>
      </div>

      <div>
        I run
        <a href="https://galacticgatewaygames.com/#" target="_blank">Galactic Gateway LLC</a>
        where I'm building
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3785230/Ninja_Froggy/" target="_blank">Ninja Froggyâ„¢</a>,
        a semi-open-world endless runner with roguelite chaos. I also dabble in jam projects like
        <a href="https://galactic-gateway-games.itch.io/bubble-bobbler" target="_blank">Bubble Bobbler</a>
        (a working title... unless people actually like it, in which case I'll pretend it was intentional).
      </div>

      <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
        Before diving diving full-time into game dev, I worked as a software engineer at Microsoft and Amazon, which means I can debug a memory leak... and
        accidentally create one in the same day. Now, I use those skills to wrangle procedural generation, enemy AI, and sometimes gravity itself.
      </div>

      <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
        When I'm not teaching a frog how to swing a katana at unsuspecting enemies, I create stylized 3D assets and occasionally
        lose track of time in Blender (we've all been there).
      </div>

      <div style="margin-top: 40px;">
        Right now it's just me, endless lines of code, and questionable life choices at 2 AM. If you'd like to chat about games, swap ideas, or team up on
        something cool, you can reach me at
        <a href="mailto:contact@galacticgatewaygames.com">contact@galacticgatewaygames.com</a>
